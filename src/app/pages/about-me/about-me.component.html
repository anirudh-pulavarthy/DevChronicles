    <h2>About <span class="highlight">me:</span></h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">{{ timeGreeting }}</span> I'm Anirudh! Originally from India, I'm now based in Chicago.</p>
    <p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Systems Science at IIT Jodhpur, and recently earned my Master’s in <span class="highlight">Computer Science from DePaul University</span> in Chicago. My interests lie in Software Engineering, Data Science, and building systems that solve meaningful, real-world problems. Whether it’s designing distributed systems, experimenting with machine learning models, or creating side projects, I enjoy turning ideas into functional, impactful software.</p>
    <p>Outside work, you’ll probably find me solving Rubik’s Cubes, watching Formula One, learning Chess tactics, or playing a quick game of Badminton. I enjoy challenges and I'm always looking to learn something new.</p>
    
    <p>Want to play a quick game of Chess? Find me on
